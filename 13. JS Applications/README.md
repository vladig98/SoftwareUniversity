# üìö JS Applications Course - SoftUni

## üßë‚Äçüè´ About the Course  

The **"JS Applications"** course will teach you how to work with **HTTP requests** and use them effectively. You will learn about **REST services**, what **BaaS** (Backend as a Service) is, and how to work with it. The course covers key concepts in **asynchronous programming** using **Promises**, **async/await**, as well as **templating** and **routing**. Throughout the course, you will build a **Single Page Application (SPA)** by applying the techniques learned in earlier lectures. You will also gain an understanding of application architecture and how to structure your applications correctly. Towards the end, you will explore **design patterns**, create custom web components using the **Web Components** standard, and set up a **Webpack** environment from scratch.

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills You'll Learn  

- **AJAX & jQuery AJAX**: Work with AJAX to handle asynchronous HTTP requests and responses  
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Understand and use asynchronous JavaScript techniques like **Promises** and **async/await**  
- **REST API**: Learn how to work with REST APIs to communicate between frontend and backend  
- **Templating & Routing**: Implement **templating** and **routing** techniques for building dynamic applications  
- **SPA Development**: Build **Single Page Applications (SPA)** using modern JavaScript  
- **Build Tools & JS Tools**: Set up build processes, use **ESLint** for code quality, and work with other JavaScript tools
