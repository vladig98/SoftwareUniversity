# 📚 Database Fundamentals Course - SoftUni

## 🧑‍🏫 About the Course  

The **Database Fundamentals** course provides a comprehensive introduction to database management and SQL. Participants will gain in-depth knowledge of one of the most widely used Database Management Systems (DBMS), **Microsoft SQL Server**. The course focuses on the relational model, data modeling using ER diagrams, and the essentials of working with SQL (data extraction, selection, projection, joins, aggregation, grouping, modification, deletion, and insertion). Emphasis is placed on **ACID transactions**, transaction processing, and practical performance tuning tips. The course also introduces key concepts like transforming databases into object-oriented models (ORM), making it easier to integrate databases into real-world applications.

This course is an essential foundation for anyone aiming to work with databases and understand their role in modern software systems.
