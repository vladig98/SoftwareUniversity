# **Exercises: Razor Views & Layouts**
Problems for exercises and homework for the [“C# MVC Frameworks - ASP.NET Core” course @ SoftUni](https://softuni.bg/trainings/2197/csharp-mvc-frameworks-asp-net-core-november-2018).
# **CHUSHKA**
**CHUSHKA** (**C**entral **H**ierarchically-**U**niversal **S**ales **H**ost **K**ickstarter **A**pplication) is a universal web application for selling products, like a web shop. You have been tasked to implement this application by the **Codex Input / Output** organization. There are several requirements you must follow in the implementation.
## **Technological Requirements**
## The application should be an **ASP.NET Core Web** app.
## **Database Requirements**
The **Database** of the **CHUSHKA** application needs to support **3 entities**:
### **User**
- Has an **Username**
- Has a **Password**
- Has a **Full Name**
- Has an **Email**
- Has an **Role** – can be one of the following values (“**User**”, “**Admin**”)
### **Product**
- Has an Id – a **GUID** string or **integer**. 
- Has a **Name**
- Has a **Price** –  think of the right data type here
- Has a **Description**
- Has a **Type** – can be one of the following values (“**Food**”, “**Domestic**”, “**Health**”, “**Cosmetic**”, “**Other**”)
### **Order**
- Has an **Id** – a **GUID** string or **integer**.
- Has a **Product** – a **Product**
- Has a **Client** – an **User**
- Has an **Ordered On** – a **DateTime**

Implement the entities with the **correct datatypes**. Think of the relationships between data models.
## **Template Requirements**
### **Guest Templates**
These are the **templates** and **functionalities**, accessible by **Guests** (**logged out** users).
#### **Index Template**

#### **Login Template**


#### **Register Template**

### **User Templates**
These are the **templates** and **functionalities**, accessible by **Users** (**logged in** users with **Role** - **User**).
#### **Index Template (logged-in users)**
**NOTE**: **Products** on this page have their **description** **substringed** to the **50th symbol**, and then accompanied by 3 dots “**…**”





#### **Product Details Template (logged-in users)**

### **Admin Templates**
These are the **templates** and **functionalities**, accessible by **Admins** (**logged in** users with **Role** - **Admin**).
#### **Index Template (logged-in admin)**
**NOTE**: **Products** on this page have their **description** **substringed** to the **50th symbol**, and then accompanied by 3 dots “**…**”

#### **Product Details Admin Template (logged-in admin)**

#### **Product Create Template (logged-in admin)**

#### **Product Edit Template (logged-in admin)**


#### **Product Delete Template (logged-in admin)**

#### **All Orders Template (logged-in admin)**


Some of the templates have been given to you in the application skeleton, but the others will be for you to implement, so make sure you implement them correctly. You can use the given ones as helpers.

**NOTE**: The templates should look **EXACTLY** as shown above.

**NOTE**: The templates do **NOT** **require** **additional** **CSS**. Only **bootstrap** and the **given css** are enough.
## **Functional Requirements**
The **Functionality Requirements** describe the functionality that the **Application** must support.

The **application** should provide **Guest** (not logged-in) users with the functionality to **login**, **register** and **view** the **Index** page.

The **application** should provide **Users** (logged-in) with the functionality to **logout**, and **view all products**, and **order** a **Product** (clicking on the **[Order]** button on the **Product** **Details** **page**).

The **application** should provide **Admins** (logged-in) with the functionality to **logout**, and **view all products**, **order** a **Product**, **create** a **Product**, **edit** a **Product**, **delete** a **Product**, and **view** all **Orders**.
#### **Users**
When you register a new **User**, it should be assigned with a **role** – **User**.

Make the **first registered** user – an **Admin**.
#### **Products**
Upon clicking on the **rectangular object** holding the data about a certain **product**, you should be redirected to its **Details page**.

**NOTE**: **Admins** can **Edit** and **Delete** products on that page.

Upon **ordering** a **Product**, an **Order** should be **created** and **persisted**.

The **application** should **store** its **data** using **Entity** **Framework** **Core**.
## **Security Requirements**
The **Security Requirements** are mainly access requirements. Configurations about which users can access specific functionalities and pages.

- **Guest** (not logged in) users can access **Index** page and functionality.
- **Guest** (not logged in) users can access **Login** page and functionality.
- **Guest** (not logged in) users can access **Register** page and functionality.
- **Users** (logged in) can access **User** **LoggedIn** **Index** page and functionality.
- **Users** (logged in) can access **User** **Product** **Details** page and functionality.
- **Users** (logged in) can access the **Order** **Product** functionality.
- **Users** (logged in) can access **Logout** functionality.
- **Admins** (logged in) can access **every functionality** a **normal** logged in **User** can.
- **Admins** (logged in) can access **Admin** **LoggedIn** **Index** page and functionality.
- **Admins** (logged in) can access the **Admin** **Product** **Details** page and functionality**.**
- **Admins** (logged in) can access the **Product** **Create** page and functionality.

- **Admins** (logged in) can access the **Product** **Delete** page and functionality.
- **Admins** (logged in) can access the **All** **Orders** page and functionality.

**TIP:** Add this code in Startup.cs to disable confirming email address of user:

`    `services.Configure<IdentityOptions>(options =>

`            `{

`                `options.SignIn.RequireConfirmedEmail = false;

`            `});

**TIP:** Add this code (remove the old one) in Startup.cs to enabling using Roles:

`    `services.AddIdentity<IdentityUser, IdentityRole>()

.AddDefaultUI()

.AddDefaultTokenProviders()

.AddEntityFrameworkStores<EventuresDbContext>();

**TIP:** Change the code in **Register.cshtml.cs** to match the requirements and **add Role to newly created User**.
