# **Lab: Unit Testing**
This document defines the lab exercises for ["C# OOP Advanced" course @ Software University](https://softuni.bg/courses/csharp-oop-advanced-high-quality-code).
# **Part I: Unit Testing Basics**
1. ## **Test Axe**
Load provided solution in Visual Studio. Add new project **Tests**

Create a class **AxeTests**

Create the following tests:

- Test if weapon loses durability after each attack
- Test attacking with a broken weapon
### **Solution**

1. ## **Test Dummy**
Create a class **DummyTests**

Create the following tests:

- Dummy loses health if attacked
- Dead Dummy throws exception if attacked
- Dead Dummy can give XP
- Alive Dummy can't give XP
### **Hints**
Follow the logic of the previous problem
1. ## **Refactor Tests**
Refactor the tests for **Axe** and **Dummy** classes

Make sure that:

- **Names** of test methods are **descriptive**
- You use **appropriate** **assertions** (assert equals vs assert true)
- You use **assertion** **messages**
- There are **no magic numbers**
- There is **no code duplication** (Don’t Repeat Yourself)
### **Hints**
Extract constants and private fields for **Axe** class

Create a method that executes **before each test**

Make use of constants and private fields, as well as add assertion messages

Follow the same logic for other test methods and **TestDummy** class
# **Part II: Dependencies**
1. ## **Fake Axe and Dummy**
Test if hero gains XP when target dies

To do this, you need to: 

- Make **Hero** class **testable** (use **Dependency Injection**)
- Introduce **Interfaces** for Axe and Dummy
  - Interface Weapon 
  - Interface Target 

Create fake Weapon and fake Dummy for the test
### **Hints**
Create **IWeapon and ITarget** interface. Modify implementation methods to **make use of interfaces.** Modify both **Axe** and **Dummy** classes.

Use **Dependency Injection** for Hero class

Create **HeroTests** class and test gaining XP functionality by faking Weapon and Target classes
1. ## **Mocking**
Include **Moq** in the project dependencies, then:

- Mock fakes from previous problem Hints

Go to **HeroTests** and refactor the code, making use of **Moq**
