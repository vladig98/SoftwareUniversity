# üìö Advanced Object-Oriented Programming Course - SoftUni

## üßë‚Äçüè´ About the Course  

The **Advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** course dives deeper into the principles and best practices for building high-quality software using C#. You will explore advanced OOP concepts, including abstraction, refactoring bad code, unit testing, reflection, working with generic data types, and using events and techniques to improve code quality. The course culminates in a practical project, where you will apply everything you‚Äôve learned to create a real-world application.

The course is part of the broader **C# Programmer** program at SoftUni, which provides comprehensive training for aspiring C# developers.
