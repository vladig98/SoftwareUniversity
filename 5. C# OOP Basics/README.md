# üìö Object-Oriented Programming Course - SoftUni

## üßë‚Äçüè´ About the Course  

The **"Object-Oriented Programming" (OOP)** course is designed to teach the principles of object-oriented programming, focusing on how to work with classes, objects, and object-oriented modeling. The course covers key OOP concepts such as abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. You'll also explore paradigms like event-driven programming and functional programming (lambda functions, closures, LINQ), as well as exception handling.

In addition to these core concepts, you will learn how to clone, compare, and traverse objects. The course also introduces popular **design patterns**, which help in building scalable and maintainable software.

The course features practical exercises, homework assignments, and projects using languages such as **C#**, **Java**, and **PHP**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills You'll Learn  

- **Working with Classes and Objects**: Learn how to freely create and use classes and objects in your programs  
- **Encapsulation**: Understand how to encapsulate data and control access to it within objects  
- **Class Hierarchies**: Learn how to design class hierarchies and organize objects in a structured way  
- **Inheritance**: Master class inheritance, including how to extend and reuse code effectively  
- **Multiple Inheritance**: Explore the concept of multiple inheritance and how to handle it in object-oriented languages  
- **Event-driven Programming**: Understand the basics of event-driven programming and how events are handled  
- **Functional Programming Concepts**: Learn about functional programming techniques like lambda functions, closures, and LINQ  
- **Exception Handling**: Get comfortable with handling errors and exceptions in your code  
- **Design Patterns**: Understand common design patterns to create clean and reusable code  

## üìÖ Course Structure  

The **Object-Oriented Programming** course is structured around the following core topics:

1. **Introduction to OOP**:  
   - Learn the fundamentals of OOP and its principles  
   - Explore the relationship between objects and classes  

2. **Encapsulation**:  
   - Understand data encapsulation and how to protect object data using access modifiers  
   - Practice writing clean and maintainable code  

3. **Inheritance**:  
   - Learn about class inheritance and how to extend functionality from base classes  
   - Work with single and multiple inheritance in different programming languages  

4. **Polymorphism**:  
   - Understand the concept of polymorphism and how it allows objects of different classes to be treated uniformly  
   - Explore method overriding and overloading  

5. **Functional Programming Techniques**:  
   - Dive into lambda expressions, closures, and LINQ  
   - Learn how functional programming fits into object-oriented designs  

6. **Object Cloning and Traversing**:  
   - Learn how to clone objects and compare them  
   - Understand how to traverse objects, especially within collections and hierarchies  

7. **Design Patterns**:  
   - Study the most commonly used design patterns, including Singleton, Factory, and Observer patterns  
   - Learn how to apply them in real-world projects  

## üöÄ Course Outcome
