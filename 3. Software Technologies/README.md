# 📚 Software Technologies Course - SoftUni

## 🧑‍🏫 About the Course  

The **"Software Technologies"** course provides students with initial knowledge of the most commonly used software technologies in the industry, allowing them to explore which technologies they prefer and wish to study further. The course covers fundamental concepts in both **front-end** and **back-end** development and consists of four main parts:

1. **HTML5 Development** (HTML + CSS + JavaScript + AJAX + REST)
2. **PHP Web Development** (PHP + MySQL)
3. **C# Web Development** (ASP.NET MVC + Entity Framework + SQL Server)
4. **Java Web Development** (Java + Spring MVC + Hibernate + MySQL)

The course is highly practical, with minimal theory and numerous examples and exercises that gradually increase in difficulty, building on each other. The focus is on giving students a broad understanding of web development technologies without delving too deeply into any one technology.

The course also includes a project where students will develop a **simple blog system** using each technology learned, applying the skills gained throughout the course.
