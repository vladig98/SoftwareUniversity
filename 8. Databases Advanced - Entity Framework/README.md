# üìö Entity Framework Core Course - SoftUni

## üßë‚Äçüè´ About the Course  

The **Entity Framework Core (EF Core)** course dives deep into the work with ORM technology, which is a standard for Object-Relational Mapping in C# and .NET Core applications. EF Core enables mapping between a relational database and an object-oriented model using both **"database first"** and **"code first"** approaches. It provides a powerful object-oriented API for querying databases and performing CRUD operations. EF Core offers an additional layer of abstraction and a simplified way of working with data in a database. 

This course demonstrates best practices for building a robust **database layer** for complex C# applications through built-in implementations of the **Repository pattern** and the **Service Layer**. The course also covers data import/export with various formats, including **JSON** and **XML**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills You'll Learn  

- **Database Design**: Learn how to design databases efficiently for C# applications  
- **Code First & Database First Approaches**: Master both techniques for creating databases and managing schemas  
- **ORM Frameworks**: Learn how to use EF Core to interact with relational databases seamlessly  
- **Data Formats**: Gain skills to handle data import/export in **JSON** and **XML** formats
