# **Exercises: Entity Relations**
This document defines the **exercise assignments** for the ["Databases Advanced – EF Core" course @ Software University](https://softuni.bg/trainings/3221/entity-framework-core-february-2021).
1. ## **Student System**
Your task is to create a database for the **Student System**, using the **EF Core Code First** approach. It should look like this:

### **Constraints**
Your **namespaces** should be:

- **P01\_StudentSystem** – for your Startup class, if you have one
- **P01\_StudentSystem.Data** – for your DbContext
- **P01\_StudentSystem.Data.Models** – for your models

Your **models** should be:

- **StudentSystemContext** – your DbContext
- **Student**:
  - StudentId
  - Name (up to 100 characters, unicode)
  - PhoneNumber (exactly 10 characters, not unicode, not required)
  - RegisteredOn
  - Birthday (not required)
- **Course**:
  - CourseId
  - Name (up to 80 characters, unicode)
  - Description (unicode, not required)
  - StartDate
  - EndDate
  - Price
- **Resource**:
  - ResourceId
  - Name (up to 50 characters, unicode)
  - Url (not unicode)
  - ResourceType (enum – can be Video, Presentation, Document or Other)
  - CourseId
- **Homework**:
  - HomeworkId
  - Content (string, linking to a file, not unicode)
  - ContentType (enum – can be Application, Pdf or Zip)
  - SubmissionTime
  - StudentId
  - CourseId
- **StudentCourse** – mapping class between **Students** and **Courses**

Table relations:	

- **One student** can have **many CourseEnrollments**
- **One student** can** have **many HomeworkSubmissions**
- **One course** can have **many StudentsEnrolled**
- **One course** can have **many Resources**
- **One course** can have **many HomeworkSubmissions**

You will need a constructor, accepting **DbContextOptions** to test your solution in **Judge**!
1. ## **Football Betting**
Your task is to create a database for a **Football Bookmaker System**, using the **Code First** approach. It should look like this:

### **Constraints**
Your **namespaces** should be:

- **P03\_FootballBetting** – for your Startup class, if you have one
- **P03\_FootballBetting.Data** – for your DbContext
- **P03\_FootballBetting.Data.Models** – for your models

Your models should be:

- **FootballBettingContext** – your DbContext
- **Team** – TeamId, Name, LogoUrl, Initials (JUV, LIV, ARS…), Budget, PrimaryKitColorId, SecondaryKitColorId, TownId
- **Color** – ColorId, Name
- **Town** – TownId, Name, CountryId
- **Country** – CountryId, Name
- **Player** – PlayerId, Name, SquadNumber, TeamId, PositionId, IsInjured
- **Position** – PositionId, Name
- **PlayerStatistic** – GameId, PlayerId, ScoredGoals, Assists, MinutesPlayed
- **Game** – GameId, HomeTeamId, AwayTeamId, HomeTeamGoals, AwayTeamGoals, DateTime, HomeTeamBetRate, AwayTeamBetRate, DrawBetRate, Result)
- **Bet** – BetId, Amount, Prediction, DateTime, UserId, GameId
- **User** – UserId, Username, Password, Email, Name, Balance

Table relationships:

- **A Team** has one **PrimaryKitColor** and one **SecondaryKitColor**
- **A Color** has **many PrimaryKitTeams** and **many SecondaryKitTeams**
- **A Team** residents in one **Town**
- **A Town** can host **several** **Teams**
- **A Game** has one **HomeTeam** and one **AwayTeam** and a **Team** can have **many** **HomeGames** and **many** **AwayGames**
- **A Town** can be placed in **one** **Country** and a **Country** can have many **Towns**
- **A Player** can play for **one** **Team** and **one** **Team** can have many **Players**
- **A Player** can play at one **Position** and one **Position** can be played by **many** **Players**
- **One** **Player** can play in **many** **Games** and in each **Game**, **many** **Players** take part (both collections must be named PlayerStatistics)
- **Many** **Bets** can be placed on **one** **Game**, but **a** **Bet** can be only on **one** **Game**
- Each bet for given game must have **Prediction** result
- **A Bet** can be placed by only **one** **User** and one **User** can place many **Bets**

Separate the **models**, **data** and **client** into **different layers** (projects).
