# **Exercises: Introduction to DB Apps**
This document defines the **exercise assignments** for the ["Databases Advanced – EF Core" course @ Software University](https://softuni.bg/trainings/1741/databases-advanced-entity-framework-october-2017).
1. ## **Initial Setup** 
Write a program that connects to your **localhost** server. Create **new database** called **MinionsDB** where we will keep information about our minions and villains. 

For each **minion** we should keep information about its **name**, **age** and **town**.  Each **town** has information about **the** **country** where it’s located. **Villains** have **name** and **evilness** **factor** (**super good**, **good**, **bad**, **evil**, **super** **evil**). Each **minion** can **serve** **several** **villains** and **each** **villain** can **have** **several** **minions** **serving** **him**. Fill all tables with at least 5 records each. 

In the end you shoud have the following tables: 

- Countries
- Towns
- Minions
- EvilnessFactors
- Villains
- MinionsVillains

1. ## **Villain Names**
Write a program that prints on the console **all villains’ names** and their **number of minions** of those who have more than 3 minions **ordered descending** by number of minions.
### **Example**

|**Output**|
| :-: |
|<p>Gru - 6</p><p>Victor - 4</p><p>Jilly – 4</p>|
1. ## **Minion Names**
Write a program that prints on the console **all minion names** and age for a given **villain id**, ordered by **name** **alphabetically.**

If there is no villain with the given ID, print "No villain with ID <**VillainId**> exists in the database.".
If the selected villain has no minions, print "(no minions)" on the second row.
### **Example**

|**Input**|**Output**||**Input**|**Output**||**Input**|**Output**|
| :-: | :-: | :- | :-: | :-: | :- | :-: | :-: |
|1|<p>Villain: Gru</p><p>1\. Bob 13</p><p>2\. Kevin 14</p><p>3\. Steward 19</p>||3|<p>Villain: Victor</p><p>1\. Bob 13</p><p>2\. Simon 22</p>||2|<p>Villain: Victor Jr.</p><p>(no minions)</p>|


|**Input**|**Output**|
| :-: | :-: |
|10|No villain with ID 10 exists in the database.|
1. ## **Add Minion**
Write a program that **reads** **information** about a minion and its villain and **adds it to the database**. In case the town of the minion is not in the database, **insert** it as well. In case the villain is not present in the database, add him too with a default **evilness** **factor** of "evil". Finally set the new minion to be a servant of the villain. Print appropriate messages after each operation.
### **Input**
The input comes in two lines:

- On the first line, you will receive the **minion** **information** in the format "Minion: <**Name**> <**Age**> <**TownName**>"
- On the second – the **villain** **information** in the format "Villain: <**Name**>"
### **Output**
After completing an operation, you must print one of the following messages:

- After adding a new **town** to the database: "Town <**TownName**> was added to the database."
- After adding a new **villain** to the database: "Villain <**VillainName**> was added to the database."
- Finally, after successfully adding the **minion** to the database and making it a **servant** of a villain: "Successfully added <**MinionName**> to be minion of <**VillainName**>."

**\*Bonus task:** Make sure all operations are executed successfully. In case of an error do not change the database.
### **Example**

|**Input**|**Output**|
| :-: | :-: |
|<p>Minion: Bob 14 Berlin</p><p>Villain: Gru</p>|Successfully added Robert to be minion of Gru.|
|<p>Minion: Cathleen 20 Liverpool</p><p>Villain: Gru</p>|<p>Town Liverpool was added to the database.</p><p>Successfully added Cathleen to be minion of Gru.</p>|
|<p>Minion: Mars 23 Sofia</p><p>Villain: Poppy</p>|<p>Villain Poppy was added to the database.</p><p>Successfully added Mars to be minion of Poppy.</p>|
|<p>Minion: Carry 20 Eindhoven</p><p>Villain: Jimmy</p>|<p>Town Eindhoven was added to the database.</p><p>Villain Jimmy was added to the database.</p><p>Successfully added Carry to be minion of Jimmy.</p>|
1. ## **Change Town Names Casing**
Write a program that **changes all town names to uppercase** for a given country. 

You will receive one line of input with the **name** of the country.

**Print the** **number of towns that were changed** in the format "<**ChangedTownsCount**> town names were affected.". On a second line, **print** the **names that were changed**, separated with a comma and a space.

If **no** **towns** were affected (the country does not exist in the database or has no cities connected to it), **print** "**No town names were affected.**".
### **Example**

|**Input**|**Output**|
| :-: | :-: |
|Bulgaria|<p>3 town names were affected. </p><p>[SOFIA, VARNA, BURGAS]</p>|
|Germany|No town names were affected.|
1. ## **\*Remove Villain** 
Write a program that receives the **ID** of a villain, **deletes him from the database** and **releases his minions** from serving to him. Print on **two** **lines** the name of the deleted villain in format "<**Name**> **was** **deleted**." and the number of minions released in format "<**MinionCount**> **minions** **were** **released**.". Make sure all operations go as planned, otherwise do not make any changes in the database.

If there is no villain in the database with the given ID, print "**No such villain was found**.".
### **Example**

|**Input**|**Output**|
| :-: | :-: |
|1|<p>Gru was deleted.</p><p>6 minions were released.</p>|
|3|<p>Victor was deleted.</p><p>0 minions were released.</p>|
|101|No such villain was found.|
1. ## **Print All Minion Names**
Write a program that **prints all minion names** from the minions table **in the following order:** first record, last record, first + 1, last - 1, first + 2, last - 2 … first + n, last - n. 

|1|10|2|9|3|8|4|7|5|6|
| :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- |
### **Example**

|**Original Order**|**Output**|
| :-: | :-: |
|<p>Bob</p><p>Kevin</p><p>Steward</p><p>Jimmy</p><p>Vicky</p><p>Becky</p><p>Jully</p>|<p>Bob</p><p>Jully</p><p>Kevin</p><p>Becky</p><p>Steward</p><p>Vicky</p><p>Jimmy</p>|
1. ## **Increase Minion Age**
Read from the console minion IDs separated by space. **Increment the age** of those minions **by 1** and make their **names title case**. Finally, **print the name and the age of all minions** in the database, each on a new row in format **"<Name> <Age>**".
### **Example**

|**Minions**|||
| :-: | :- | :- |
|**Id**|**Name**|**Age**|
|1|bob|14|
|2|stuart|22|
|3|kevin|13|
|4|jimmy|49|
|5|vicky jackson|26|


|**Input**|**Output**||**Input**|**Output**|
| :-: | :- | :-: | :-: | :- |
|2 1 4|<p>Bob 15</p><p>Stuart 23</p><p>kevin 13</p><p>Jimmy 50</p><p>vicky jackson 26</p>||5|<p>bob 14</p><p>stuart 22</p><p>kevin 13</p><p>jimmy 49</p><p>Vicky Jackson 27</p>|
1. ## **Increase Age Stored Procedure** 
Create stored procedure <a name="ole_link2"></a><a name="ole_link1"></a>**usp\_GetOlder** (**directly in the database** using **Management Studio** or any other similar tool) that receives **MinionId** and **increases that minion’s age by 1**. Write a program that **uses that stored procedure to increase the age** of a minion whose id will be given as input from the console. After that **print the name and the age** of that minion.
### **Example**

|**Minions**|||
| :-: | :- | :- |
|**Id**|**Name**|**Age**|
|1|bob|14|
|2|steward|22|
|3|kevin|13|
|4|jimmy|49|
|5|vicky jackson|26|


|**Input**|**Output**|
| :-: | :-: |
|1|bob – 15 years old|
|3|kevin – 14 years old|
|5|vicky jackson – 27 years old|
